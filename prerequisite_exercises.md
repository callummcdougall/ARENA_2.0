# Pre-ARENA PyTorch Exercises

These exercises will prepare you for actual implementation challenges that will come up during the course. They are not comprehensive, but feeling comfortable with these techniques will save you time during the course and allow you to focus more on concepts and less on coaxing PyTorch and einops to do what you want.

*Note - if you have trouble with any installations (e.g. Python, VSCode, or PyTorch), you can access the exercises via the [associated Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16DgeeF9FPFEFSqyAiaAIfKKIAYrs0t0X?usp=sharing). You can create a copy of this in your own directory, then edit and run code cells from there. Definitely don't spend too long on the installation if it's causing you frustration.*

## Setup

### Installing Python

If you don't have Python 3.8 or higher installed, the most foolproof way is to first install Miniconda from:

[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.htm](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.htm)

### Installing PyTorch

Follow the instructions at [https://pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/), using the "conda" option if you installed Miniconda. You don't need a GPU or CUDA for these exercises, so you can use the CPU compute platform.

### Installing `einops`

`pip install einops` at the command line should be all you need.

### Visual Studio Code

We will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the official IDE for the course. Compared to PyCharm, it's free and roughly as good. Compared to Jupyter, it has superior autocomplete, static type-checking, Git integration, and an integrated debugger. Tips for VS Code:

- You can view Markdown files in VS Code by right clicking on the file in the Explorer pane and selecting "Open Preview".
- Enable word wrap in VS Code using Alt+Z or View -> Word Wrap.
- You can have a Jupyter-like notebook experience within a regular `.py` file by using the special comment `# %%` to delimit notebook cells. VS Code will recognize these and give you the option to run cells (Shift-Enter by default on my machine) or debug cells individually.

## Workflow

- The most basic thing you can do is copy the exercises into a new `.py` file and run the file as a normal script. Wherever you see a `pass` statement, this is where you write your code so that the function behaves as described and the assertions pass.
- It's more efficient to use the REPL and split up your `.py` file with notebook cells using `# %%`. Write and check your code one line at a time, verifying they do what you expect and only once you think it's working, paste it into the function body to confirm. This avoids spending time figuring out which line of code isn't working properly.

## Tips

- To get the most out of these exercises, make sure you understand why all of the assertions should be true, and feel free to add more assertions.
- If you're having trouble writing a batched computation, try doing the unbatched version first.
- If you find these exercises challenging, it would be beneficial to go through them a second time so they feel more natural.

## Support

At some point you'll be added to a ARENA Slack and be able to ask questions there. If you need help before then, feel free to email Callum at `callum@arena.education` directly.
